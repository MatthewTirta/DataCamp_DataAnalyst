# DataCamp Data Analyst Projects

Welcome to **DataCamp Data Analyst**, a growing portfolio of projects completed as part of the DataCamp Data Analyst track.  This repository serves as my personal playground for sharpening data‑analysis skills and showcasing what I’ve learned.  Think of it as a living document—new folders and notebooks will appear over time as I tackle more assignments and exploratory analyses.

## 🗂️ Projects

Each project in this repo lives in its own folder under the root.  To add a new project, simply create a new directory at the top level (for example, `My New Project/`) and drop your notebook, data and any supporting assets into it.  Then update the list below:

| Project                               | Description                                                  | Folder |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Investigating Netflix Movies**      | Explore Netflix’s catalog of 1990s movies, identify the most common runtime and count short action films | [Investigating Netflix Movies](Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies/) |

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

This repository primarily uses the following technologies:

* **Python** – the core language for all notebooks.
* **Jupyter Notebook** – combining code, narrative and visualizations in one place.
* **pandas**, **NumPy** and **matplotlib** – common data‑analysis libraries.
* **Markdown** – for documentation like this README.

As I progress through the DataCamp track, these tools may expand to include SQL, data visualization libraries or other languages, and I’ll update this section accordingly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To work with any of the projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MatthewTirta/DataCamp_DataAnalyst.git
   cd DataCamp_DataAnalyst
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder** you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd "Investigating Netflix Movies"
   # or: cd "YourProjectName"
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (these may vary by project).  For Python‑based notebooks:
   ```bash

   ```
4. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```
   or use your preferred environment like JupyterLab or VS Code.

Feel free to branch off, run your own analyses, or even contribute back if you discover something interesting.
